# UI-UX-INTERVIEW-TEST
* I picked a furniture wesbite as for my Ui website  design called Maneskin Furniture.I created a homepage and a product detail page .
* I used Opens Sans as my font because it is a popular font to be used on Ui designs.
* I  used a four colour piece pallate throught my design.I picked this color pallate because the are warm color and does not hurt the persona's eyes in long usage time.
